    Generate a random Rubik's Cube algorithm for testing purposes.
    This method creates a sequence of random cube moves outside of the Cube class,
    primarily intended for testing and validation scenarios. It ensures no consecutive
    moves are performed on the same face to avoid redundant operations.
    Args:
        length (int, optional): The number of moves to generate. Defaults to 10.
    Returns:
        str: A string representation of the algorithm with moves separated by spaces.
             Each move consists of a face letter (F, B, R, L, U, D) optionally 
             followed by a modifier (' for counterclockwise, 2 for double turn).
    Example:
        >>> random_algorithm(5)
        "R U' F2 D L'"
